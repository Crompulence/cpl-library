CPL Library socket 
==================

This directory is where the source code, libraries and binaries are stored for
the CPL Library socket. The source code is located in ./src/ and the
dynamic-link library binaries are created in a new folder ./lib/. 
Executable solver applications are created in the a folder ./bin.

The following environnment variables:

    FOAM_CPL_SOCKET_LIBBIN = $FOAM_INST_DIR/cpl-socket/lib
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH        = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$FOAM_CPL_LIBBIN

**must be defined** in order for a) the compilation to work and b) the library
to be found by the ld linker. They are conveniently defined in the config 
file SOURCEME, which may be found in the level above this README file: 

    $  cd ../
    $  source SOURCEME
    $  cd -


Compilation:
============

    $  ./Allwmake

N.B.: warnings from the included MPI headers may be ignored. 

Overview of subdirectories in this folder:
==========================================

CPLPstream:

    OpenFOAM's parallel-computing communications supports a number of different
    paradigms, including MPI. In order to support all of them, it wraps all 
    communication functions in a library called "Pstream". CPL Library is based
    on MPI, but requires the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator to be split into 
    two "realm" communicators - one for MD, and the other for CFD. All 
    subsequent operations that would have been on MPI_COMM_WORLD in the MD
    and CFD coupled programs must now be called on the realm communicator
    CPL_REALM_COMM. 

    CPLPstream replicates OpenFOAM's MPI Pstream, where CPL_REALM_COMM has
    been substituted in place of MPI_COMM_WORLD.


CPLSocket:

    The interface to CPL Library is implemented in a single class named
    CPLSocket. This directory holds its source code. 

solvers:

    OpenFOAM is implemented as a set of libraries, and it is up to the 
    user to develop their own main-level applications that use these 
    libraries. This directory contains the source code for a coupled
    incompressible solver CPLIcoFoam that is based on OpenFOAM's icoFoam.
