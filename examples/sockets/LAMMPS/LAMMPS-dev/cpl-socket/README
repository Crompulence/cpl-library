Calling make here required source SOURCEME.sh to have been called in the LAMMPS directory so $LAMMPS_PATH is defined. Build is achieved by calling:

make lmp_cpl

This calls "enable-packages.sh" which changed diretory to "$LAMMPS_PATH/src" and loops through "lammps_packages.in", switching off and on packaged and then building LAMMPS as a shared library. The CPL socket code is then built with LAMMPS and CPL library linked in. 

Troubleshooting:

If packages are missing, then cd $LAMMPS_PATH/src and turn off packages off, for example to not build kokkos, use

make no-kokkos 

as required...
