Topology_test contains a standalone code that is designed to perform the
communications and mapping setup of the coupler, before performing gather,
scatter, send and recv processes with dummy arrays. 

The python script "singlerun.py" reads the input file "TOPOL.in", and makes
 a system call to mpiexec with the appropriate number of processors. 

"topology_test.py" is in development and is designed to allow easy parametric
studies of inputs to the coupler.
