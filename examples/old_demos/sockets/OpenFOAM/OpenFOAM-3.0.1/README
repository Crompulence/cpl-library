About
=====

This directory contains a clone of the publically released source code
for the OpenFOAM CFD software package. It also contains source code that allows
OpenFOAM to be interfaced to CPL Library in coupled MD/CFD simulations.



Compilation procedure
=====================

The compilation of OpenFOAM, coupled with CPL Library, should be performed in
the following order:

    1. Compile CPL Library (see the README in the cpl-library repository
       top-level directory, hereafter referred to as $CPLTOPDIR). With a bit
       of luck, the following commands will suffice:

        $  cd $CPLTOPDIR/cpl
        $  make all

    2. Compile OpenFOAM without linking to CPL Library 
       from the repository's source, which is located in 
       openfoam/OpenFOAM-2.3.x/. BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PLEASE READ THE
       INSTRUCTIONS BELOW FOR COMPILING OPENFOAM FROM THE REPOSITORY. 
       If the required environment variables are set correctly, the following 
       commands should work:

        $  cd $CPLTOPDIR/openfoam/OpenFOAM-2.3.x
        $  ./Allwmake

Finally, 

    3. Compile the socket libraries and applications in openfoam/cpl-socket. 
        
        $  cd $CPLTOPDIR/openfoam/cpl-socket
        $  ./Allwmake 


Step 3 above depends on steps 1 and 2 having been successfully completed.




Step 2: More information on compiling OpenFOAM from repository source
=====================================================================

Before attempting to compile OpenFOAM, please familiarise yourself with the 
repository installation instructions that may be found at:

    http://www.openfoam.org/download/git.php

Part of this process requires some environment variables to be defined. This is
usually performed by sourcing OpenFOAM-2.3.x/etc/bashrc (as in the installation
instructions above), but it is likely that a few environment variables will
require changing for your machine. An example of these changes is provided in
$CPLTOPDIR/openfoam/SOURCEME:

    $  cd $CPLTOPDIR/openfoam
    $  source SOURCEME
    $  (cd OpenFOAM-2.3.x && ./Allwmake)
    
You will need to correct the settings (like MPI implementation) in the
set of environment variables, otherwise OpenFOAM will not compile properly for 
use with CPL Libraray.
