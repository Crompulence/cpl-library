        <h2>Quick-start guide: coupling with CPL Library</h2>
        The aim of the following text is to lead the user, by example, from the
        start to the end; from downloading <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark>, all the way through to
        running and analysing a coupled simulation. 

        Please <a href="/contact.shtml">get in touch</a> if something is
        unclear or just plain wrong!

        <h2 id="prerequisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
        Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your
        system:
        <ul>
            <li>A C/C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard, </li>
            <li>A Fortran compiler that supports the F2008 standard, and</li>
            <li>An MPI library</li>
        </ul>

        <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> was developed and tested using the
        <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler collection </a>
        and <a href="https://www.mpich.org">MPICH</a>,
        which are both free and open-source. The
        following guide assumes that you're working with a Unix-like operating
        system like Linux or OS X. Please <a href="/contact.shtml">email us</a>
        if you'd like some help getting it to work on Windows.


        <p>
        <em> IMPORTANT NOTE: To minimise compatibility problems, 
             you are advised to install gcc-5 and gfortran-5 (from a 
             <a href="/faq.shtml">ppa</a> or 
             build it yourself), then download the latest mpich and
             build this new version with gcc-5 and gfortran-5. 
        </em>

             <div class="code"> $ ./configure --prefix \ <br>
                                /PATH/TO/INSTALL/mpich_gcc5/ \ <br>
                                              CXX=gcc-5 FC=gfortran-5 <br>
                                $make <br>
                                $make install <br>
                                $ export PATH:/PATH/TO/INSTALL/mpich_gcc5/:$PATH <br>
             </div>
        <em>
             <br>
             You should then build cpl-library and ALL the codes you 
             plan to couple with this new version of mpic++ and mpif90.
             Although this sounds like a lot of work, especially if you
             have custom versions of codes already installed, it is
             absolutely essential to guarantee correct behaviour in a coupled 
             simulation.

        <h2 id="download">Download</h2>

        <p>
            To keep up-to-date with bug-fixes and future developments, the
            user is encouraged to download the library using the git version
            control system:
            <div class="code">
                <p>
                    $  git clone https://github.com/Crompulence/cpl-library.git
                </p>
            </div>

            which will download to a new folder in the current directory named
            "cpl-library".
        </p>


        <p> 
            If you don't want to use git, a snapshot of the latest code can
            also be downloaded in a zip file from the <a
            href="/download.shtml">download page</a>. Unzip the file and rename
            the folder "cpl-library": 
            <div class="code"> $  unzip cpl-library-master.zip </div> 
            <div class="code"> $  mv cpl-library-master cpl-library</div> 
        </p>


        <h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>

        <p>
            Compiling <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> itself, as a shared library, is
            likely to work with Gnu make:

            <div class="code"> $  cd cpl-library/cpl</div>
            <div class="code"> $  make </div>

        </p>

        <p>
            where the library will be created at the path,
        </p>

        <div class="code"> cpl-library/cpl/lib/ </div>
    
        <p>
            C++ headers and Fortran use-modules are placed in
        </p>
            
        <div class="code"> cpl-library/cpl/include/ </div>

        <p>
            The wrapper binaries for cplf90 and cplc++ are located in
        </p>
            
        <div class="code"> cpl-library/cpl/bin/ </div>

        <p>
            This build has been verified for the GCC compiler collection and
            MPICH. Support for Intel (R)
            compiler suites is in development. For
            more specific build requirements, the user should copy and change
            the compiler template file as outlined in cpl-library/README.
        </p>

        <h2 id="MLE">Demo: a minimal linking example</h2>

        <p>
            This simple example shows you how to link two massively-parallel 
            codes with <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark>. The example MD code is written in Fortran,
            and the CFD code in C++. Both programs may run with any number of
            processes. Take a look at the simple Fortran example code:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <!--#include virtual="demo-codes/md_init_fortran.html"-->
        </div>

        <p>
            This code initialises MPI, and gets the MD communicator from
            <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark>. It must, therefore, be linked to both the MPI and CPL
            libraries when it is compiled. The compilation can be performed with a call to mpif90 of the form:
        </p>
 

        <div class="code"> 

            $  mpif90 ./cfd_init.f90 \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                      -I${CPL_PATH}/include \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      -L${CPL_PATH}/lib  \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      -Wl,-rpath=${CPL_PATH}/lib/ -lcpl \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      -o ./mdProgram

        </div>

        <p>
            If you're not familiar with the processes involved in linking
            shared libraries to software, there are a few things to notice
            in the above command. 
            The variable CPL_PATH should be set to the location of the base
            directory of the <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> downloaded,
            unzipped and build in the previous section. 
            First, we've specified the location of the 
            Fortran module files with the <code>-I</code> flag. 
            Second, the location of the cpl-library shared library, 
            <code>libcpl.so</code>, is specified with <code>-L</code>. 
            Because the library is a dynamic one, not in the standard
            <code>/usr/lib</code> location, we also provide the built 
            executable with a reference to the library location with <br>
            <code>-Wl,-rpath=${CPL_PATH}/lib/</code>. 
            Note: all compiler flags for the MPI library
            are handled automatically by the <code>mpic++</code> and
            <code>mpif90</code> compiler wrappers. 
<!--
            Finally, because the library is
            written with both C++ and Fortran, <code>-lc</code> and
            <code>-lstdc++</code> are required
            to link to the C++ standard libraries with the Fortran compiler.
            The executable is saved to <code>md/mdProgram</code>. 
-->
            Two helper scripts similar to MPI are provided to simplify linking in
            ${CPL_PATH}/bin folder. These can be included in the path using,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            $ source SOURCEME.sh
        </div>

        <p>
            Note if you want to specify the cpl path to a different directory than the location
            of SOURCEME.sh, you need to set
        </p>

        <div class="code"> $  CPL_PATH=/some/path/to/cpl/library/</div>

        <p>
            manually. After adding  <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark>  to your
            path with SOURCEME.sh, the previous build statement then simply becomes,
        </p>

        <div class="code"> cplf90 ./md_init.f90 -o ./mdProgram </div>

        <p>
            Next we build an equivalent CFD demo program written in C++:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <!--#include virtual="demo-codes/md_init_cpp.html"-->
        </div>

        <p>
            Like the Fortran example above, the compilation command 
            is of the form:
        </p>
 
        <div class="code"> 

            $ mpic++ ./cfd_init.cpp \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                     -I${CPL_PATH}/include \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
                     -L${CPL_PATH}/lib  \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                     -Wl,-rpath=${CPL_PATH}/lib/ -lcpl  \ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                     -o ./cfdProgram  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

        </div>

        <p>
            This time, the <code>-I</code> flag tells the compiler where to
            find the <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> C++ header files, and we must link to the 
            <code>-lgfortran</code> and <code>-lmpifort</code> Fortran libraries.
            Alternativly using cplc++ wrapper,
        </p>

        <div class="code"> cplc++ ./cfd_init.cpp -o ./mdProgram </div>

        <p>
            Now the demo codes are compiled, they can be executed together in 
            the run directory with:
        </p>
     
        <div class="code"> 
            mpiexec -n 8 ./mdProgram : -n 4 ./cfdProgram
        </div>
    
        <p>
            That's it! The codes should execute, and <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> will tell you
            that its internal communicators have been initialised.
            Obviously it is rarely that simple, if you get any problems,
            please check out the <a class="links" href='/faq.shtml'>faq</a>
            section and if this doesn't help, please get in touch.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fortran code can also be easily replaced with a python example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <!--#include virtual="demo-codes/md_init_python.html"-->
        </div>

        <p>
            there is no need to compile, but the
            path must be correctly set. This can also be done using,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            $ source SOURCEME.sh
        </div>

        <p>
            if you haven't already. 
            SOURCEME.sh appends the library location and python ctype bindings 
            to the PYTHONPATH variable. A python and C++ coupled
            example can then be run using,
        </p>

        <div class="code"> 
            mpiexec -n 8 python ./md_init.py : -n 4 ./cfdProgram
        </div>
 
        <p>
            These examples don't actually do anything interesting, and so
            in the next section, the minimal code is presented to send and recieve data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="linking">Demo: a minimum send/recv example</h2>

        <p>
            This section outlines a first and simplest example of 
            coupling. An array of cells with three components per cell
            is packed with the x, y and z global index of the cell,
            shown here for 2D indices only,
        </p>

        <img width=80% src="./images/cfd_md_cell_index.png" >

        <p>
            This is sent, from CFD to MD and checked.
            Although this isn't the most exciting example, it does
            provide a clear picture of exactly how <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> works.
            The global system of cells is setup and split over many processors
            in both the MD and CFD codes. The coupled simulation has some 
            overlap, specified in the COUPLER.in file in the cpl folder. This
            determines how the two codes overlap and the topological
            relationship between them. The mapping of processors is handled
            by <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> using a minimal set of inputs.
            First, initialisation is performed with a call to 
            <a class="links" href='/api-docs/fortran_api.shtml#f/_/cpl_init'>CPL_init</a>.
            This splits MPI_COMM_WORLD into two MPI communicators for the MD and CFD realms. 
            The grid information and topological mapping is performed using calls to
            <a class="links" href='/api-docs/fortran_api.shtml#f/_/cpl_setup_md'>CPL_setup_md</a> on the MD side and 
            <a class="links" href='/api-docs/fortran_api.shtml#f/_/cpl_setup_cfd'>CPL_setup_cfd</a> for the CFD. 
            The 
            <a class="links" href='/api-docs/fortran_api.shtml#f/_/cpl_send'>CPL_send</a>
            and 
            <a class="links" href='/api-docs/fortran_api.shtml#f/_/cpl_recv'>CPL_recv</a>
            functions then exchange all 
            information for the grid in the overlap region with all information
            exchanged only between processes that are topological overlapping.
            This avoids any global communications and maintains the scaling of 
            the two codes. The send/recv limits are specified in 
            global grid coordinates and should be consistent between codes.
            This means the user does not need to know about the 
            processor topology of the two codes.

            The examples in this section start with fortran, then c++ and
            finally python. 
            
             
        </p>


        <h3 id="linking_fortran">Fortran</h3>
        <p>
            This section outlines a minimal example in Fortan which will send
            information between an MD and CFD code. 
        <p>
            The CFD code is first,
        </p>

            </details>
 

        <p>
            Now the MD code which receives data from the CFD code
            and 
        </p>

            </details>   


        <p>
            This can be built using,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
           $  cplf90 ./md_recv_cells.f90 -o ./md.exe
 
        </div>

        <p>
            and similar for cfd executable,
        </p>

      <div class="code">
           $  cplf90 ./cfd_send_cells.f90   -o ./cfd.exe
        </div>

        <p>
            and run using
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            mpiexec -n 4 ./cfd.exe : -n 16 ./md.exe
        </div>

        <p>
            The coupled simulation sends data from the 16 MD 
            processors to the 4 CFD processors. These are then
            checked to ensure they correspond the correct
            locations in space and any errors are printed.
            A correct output will contain something like,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            MD -- (rank= 2) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank= 3) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank= 6) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank= 7) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank=10) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank=11) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.
            MD -- (rank=14) CELLS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED CORRECTLY.

            This section outlines a minimal example in python which will send
            information between an MD and CFD code. The CFD code is first.

        <p>
            This minimal send and receive example forms part of the testing 
            framework of the <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> and represents the core functionality
            of coupled simulation. Designing coupled simulation can still be
            more tricky than this simple example, owing to the different possible
            data formats in the various codes as well as different grid index systems.
            In the next section, visualisation of a coupled code is presented to show
            how design and development of coupled simulation can be aided by 
            minimal CFD and MD code with <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> tools.

        <p>
            The previous section, although an important test is not particularly exciting.
            In this section, a more interesting visual example is presented which uses
            the python interface and matplotlib to plot results. A fortran
            and C++ example MD code specifies a test sinusoidal function in x, y and z of the form
            and sends this to a python CFD code which plots the results. The fortran and
            C++ codes are almost identical to the <a href=#linking>previous example</a> , 
            although this time the MD code sends to the CFD.

            The grid is set to a function of x, y and z based on cell numbers.
            The above plot shows the x and y dependence of the functions on the top 
            figure and the x z dependence on the bottom layer.
            In order to understand this in the context of the coupler grid, a python
            function can be used to add a grid to the plot,

        <p>
            There are no changes needed to the sending code. 
            The python code to use this in the plot introduced the cpl_get 
            function in order to obtain the grid properties. All details of the
            coupled configuration are stored locally on every processor so no
            communication is required for a call to CPL_get. The code receive data
            and plots over the grid resulting the following,
        </p> 

        <img width=80% src="./images/topology_grid_plot.png" >

        <p>
            Notice that the MD code is running on four processor, highlighted on the grid plot and the
            sine function is clearly continuous and correct over the processor boundaries.
            A single CFD processor receives and plots the data for simplicity here.
            The CPL could be used in this manner on an MD or CFD simulation running on
            thousands of processors and the <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> linked only to display current values.
            By linking to a particular location, a slice or plot along an axis could be used
            without requiring global communications. In this way, the current state of the simulation can
            be checked while maintaining the scaling of the codes.
            This is a very important function to use when developing coupled simulation.
            As typically you will be linking two highly complex and non-linear codes, they MUST
            be verified individually before attempting to link. Using the python interface with
            plotting, the two codes can be visualised, unit-tested and verified individually.
            The simple plotting interface can then be simply swapped out for the other code.
            Both for debugging and controlling simulation, <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> can be used to not only display the 
            current state of the simulation, but also to control it by specifiying a boundary condition.
            In the next section, the plotting code sends back a user changeable value to interactivly
            develop a coupled simulation.

        <p>
            This allows an interactive code to adjust the various values, usign a send and
            receive. The python code to do this uses matplotlib widgets and is as follows,

        <p>
            The previous MD code needs to be adapted to receive data from the
            CFD code, as well as evolve in time to reflect the potentially changing
            boundary.

            Again, this highlights a use of <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> framework beyond simple
            coupled simulation, where a user interface could be attached to a large scale
            simulation running on many processors to visualise and adjust the simulation
            as required during a run. 

            In the next section, the example of a fully coupled
            CFD and MD code is presented.

            This equation is simulated using a simple finite difference method 
            with a forward Euler for time discretisation and central difference in space. 
            The code is written in an object oriented manner, so a CFD object can be

            The minimal MD code solves Newton's law for the N body problem. 
            This is extremely slow in python so only a very small number of molecules are used. 
            A simply cell list is also included to speed up the simulation and time is advanced
            using a Verlet algorithm. A number of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and coupling 
            specific features are required, including fixed wall molecules, a specular wall at
            the domain top, constraint force and averaging to get a velocity field.
            The MD code is also written in an object oriented manner with functions for force calculation, time evolution
            and plotting along with more exotic velocity averaging, constraint forces and specular walls.

        <p>
            The code to coupled the MD and CFD code is written as
            two separate files to instantiate the respective MD or CFD solver object. 
            The <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark> is fexible in that both CFD and MD could be contained in a single file,
            however the recommended way to couple is through the MPMD model with all
            data exchange through <mark class="CPL">CPL library</mark>. This keeps the scope of both codes
            separated and ensures changes to each piece of coupled software is minimised.
            The coupled MD code is here, notice that most of the code is boilerplate problem setup,

            Note that these toy MD and CFD codes are provided as an example and there is no guarantee of the
            accuracy or correctness of either code. In fact, the constraint applied appears to need
