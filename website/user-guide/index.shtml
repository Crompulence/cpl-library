        <h1>Step-by-step guide: coupling with CPL Library</h1>
        The aim of the following text is to lead the user right from the start
to the end: from downloading CPL Library, all the way through to running and
analysing a coupled simulation. Please <a href="/contact.shtml">get in
touch</a> if something is unclear or just plain wrong!

        <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
        Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your
system:
        <ul>
            <li>A C/C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard, </li>
            <li>A Fortran compiler that supports the F2008 standard, and</li>
            <li>An MPI library</li>
        </ul>

        CPL Library was developed and tested using the
        <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler collection </a>
        and <a href="https//www.mpich.org">MPICH</a>,
        which are both free and open-source.

        <h2>Download and unzip</h2>

        <p>
            Assuming you're compiling on linux, the latest zip file can be
            obtained from github using wget:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            wget https://github.com/Crompulence/cpl-library/archive/master.zip
        </div>

        <p>
            Alternativly, you can download with git or by clicking on the
            direct download link. Please see the
            <a href="../download.shtml">download</a> page.
            Next, we want to unzip the file into a folder called cpl-library
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            unzip ./master.zip
        </div>

        <p>
            If you have problems with this, you may need to download
            unzip. For ubuntu, this can be obtained with 
            sudo apt-get install unzip or equivalent for 
            you distribution.
            Once you've unzipped the file, change directory to the
            cpl build directory ready to compile.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            cd cpl-library-master/cpl/
        </div>


        <h2>Compilation</h2>

        <p>
            Compiling CPL-Library itself, as a statically-linked library, is
            likely to work simply by running Gnu make:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            make all
        </div>

        <p>
            This build has currently been tested using 
            gfortran, gcc and mpich. Support for the intel
            compiler suite is under development. For more
	    complicated builds, the template file should be 
	    changed as outlined in the README within the directory.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            make PLATFORM=template cpl_
        </div>

        <p>
            where "template" refers to the name of the included file /make/template.inc, in
            which the compilers and flags are defined. The template provided is likely to
            work for most machines, but the user is advised to create their own version.
        </p>
