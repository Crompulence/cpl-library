            CPL Library is a communications and topology management system for
            coupling <i>any</i> continuum fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to
            <i>any</i> molecular dynamics (MD) code. CPL Library is free and
            open-source. <a href="download.shtml">Download</a> the library
            today!
        </p>

        <p>
            A full tutorial and example codes written in modern C++ and Fortran
            are under development and will come bundled with CPL Library very
            soon. Their purpose will be to provide templates that are easily 
            replaced by the user with any CFD or MD code of their choice.

        <h2>The coupling approach with CPL Library</h2>


        <!-- <div width=80%; align="center"; style="float:right";> -->

        <p> 
            CPL Library currently facilitates a domain-decomposition style of
            coupling. With this approach, a CFD program solves the continuum
            equations of motion in the upper region of a domain, and an MD
            simulation solves discrete-particle equations of motion in the
            lower region. The two programs exchange data (in this case with
            CPL Library) to ensure selected field variables are consistent
            where the MD and CFD domains overlap.  
        </p>
            

        <p> 
            Some results of an example coupled simulation of planar-Couette
            flow (simple shear of a Newtonian fluid between two flat plates)
            can be seen in the videos below. The molecules have been
            coloured by their local streamwise velocity, and the velocity of
            the continuum field is shown by the colour of the solid plane at
            the edge of the domain.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The temporal evolution of the velocity field
            is consistent with the expected analytical solution for
            planar-Couette flow:

        <p> 
            The possibilities for performing simulations beyond this canonical
            flow configuration are vast. For example, coupled simulations may
            be used to model the effect of complex wall textures in turbulent
            flows:

        <h2>Supported Configurations</h2>

        <p>
            CPL Library is written in Fortran with a C/C++ wrapper and is not 
            expected to change much from its current form.
            The CFD and MD code are assumed to be massively parallel, running 
            on a number of processors communicating through the message 
            passing interface (MPI).
            The supported setup is a domain decomposition, with MD near the 
            wall and CFD further away.

        </p>

        <div width=80%; align="center">
            <img width=100% src="images/CPL_setup.png">
        </div>



        <p>

            Currently this is the only case which is officially supported.
            In addition, the topological mapping assumes there is always at 
            least one CFD processor to each MD and that processor boundaries 
            align between the two codes
            (i.e. 2 CFD and 3 MD would not be supported).
            This setup is general enough to support, as a special case, 
            complete overlap between the two codes.
        </p>


        <div width=80%; align="center">
            <img width=100% src="images/CPL_setup_overlap.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            Despite this limitation, the design of the coupling software means
            that more complex cases, (e.g. non-uniform grids, 
            multiple MD or CFD domains) can be accommodated by simply changing 
            the mapping module of the coupler.
