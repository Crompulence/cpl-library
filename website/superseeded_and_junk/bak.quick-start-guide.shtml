        <h1>Quick-start guide: coupling with CPL Library</h1>
        The aim of the following text is to lead the user, by example, from the
        start to the end; from downloading CPL Library, all the way through to
        running and analysing a coupled simulation. 

        Please <a href="/contact.shtml">get in touch</a> if something is
        unclear or just plain wrong!

        <h2 id="prerequisites">Pre-requisites</h2></a>
        Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your
        system:
        <ul>
            <li>A C/C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard, </li>
            <li>A Fortran compiler that supports the F2008 standard, and</li>
            <li>An MPI library</li>
        </ul>

        CPL Library was developed and tested using the
        <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler collection </a>
        and <a href="https//www.mpich.org">MPICH</a>,
        which are both free and open-source. The
        following guide assumes that you're working with a Unix-like operating
        system like Linux or OS X. Please <a href="/contact.shtml">email us</a>
        if you'd like some help getting it to work on Windows.

        <h2 id="download">Download</h2></a>

        <p>
            To keep up-to-date with bug-fixes and future developments, the
            user is encouraged to download the library using the git version
            control system:
            <div class="code">
                <p>
                    $  git clone https://github.com/Crompulence/cpl-library.git
                </p>
            </div>

            which will download to a new folder in the current directory named
            "cpl-library".
        </p>


        <p> 
            If you don't want to use git, a snapshot of the latest code can
            also be downloaded in a zip file from the <a
            href="/download.shtml">download page</a>. Unzip the file and rename
            the folder "cpl-library": 
            <div class="code"> $  unzip cpl-library-master.zip </div> 
            <div class="code"> $  mv cpl-library-master cpl-library</div> 
        </p>


        <!--<div class="code">
            wget https://github.com/Crompulence/cpl-library/archive/master.zip
        </div>

        <p>
            Next, we want to unzip the file into a folder called cpl-library
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            unzip ./master.zip
        </div>

        <p>
            If you have problems with this, you may need to download
            unzip. For ubuntu, this can be obtained with 
            sudo apt-get install unzip or equivalent for 
            you distribution.
            Once you've unzipped the file, change directory to the
            cpl build directory ready to compile.
        </p>-->



        <h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>

        <p>
            Compiling CPL Library itself, as a statically-linked library, is
            likely to work with Gnu make:

            <div class="code"> $  cd cpl-library/cpl</div>
            <div class="code"> $  make </div>

        </p>

        <p>
            where the library will be created at the path,
        </p>

        <div class="code"> cpl-library/cpl/lib/libcpl.a </div>
    
        <p>
            C++ headers and Fortran use-modules are placed in
        </p>
            
        <div class="code"> cpl-library/cpl/include/ </div>


        <p>
            This build has been verified for the GCC compiler collection and
            MPICH. Support for Intel (R)
            compiler suites is in development. For
            more specific build requirements, the user should copy and change
            the compiler template file as outlined in cpl-library/README.
        </p>

        <!--<div class="code">
            make PLATFORM=template cpl_
        </div>

        <p>
            where "template" refers to the name of the included file /make/template.inc, in
            which the compilers and flags are defined. The template provided is likely to
            work for most machines, but the user is advised to create their own version.
        </p>-->
