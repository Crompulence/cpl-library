CPL Library is a communications and topology management system for
coupling any continuum fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to any molecular dynamics
(MD) code written in either C, C++ or Fortran. A demonstration of CPL Library's
capability is included in the "demo" folder. Inside the demo, "dummy" MD and
CFD programs are coupled via CPL Library and exchange data on a virtual
topology. The user is encouraged to examine the source code of these programs,
which are an easy-to-understand example of how to couple other programs with
CPL Library.

1. Pre-requisites for compilation
=================================

- A C++14 compiler 
- A Fortran 2008 compiler
- An MPI library 

CPL Library was developed and tested using the GCC compiler collection and
MPICH, which are both free and open-source. 



2. Install

    a) Compiling the library 
    ------------------------

    Compiling CPL-Library itself, as a statically linked library, is likely to 
    work with the makefile provided:

        $  cd cpl
        $  make 

    If this doesn't work, the compilers and flags may need to be specified
    manually. The makefiles provided with CPL Library include the file
    make/[platform].inc, where the variable [platform] is specified exactly by
    the contents of the file make/PLATFORM. A template is provided in
    make/template.inc, and the file make/PLATFORM contains only the string 
    "template" by default. The template provided is likely to
    work for most machines, but the user is advised to create their own version
    (make/user-include.inc, for example):

        $  cd ./make
        $  cp template.inc user-include.inc
        $  vi user-include.inc                     (make any necessary changes)
        $  cd ../cpl
        $  make PLATFORM=user-include



    b) Building the demo applications
