TESTS 
===============
Single Particle 
===============
1) Particle with fully periodic system and subject to a force in y 
    a) Force constant, check vs constant acceleration equations
    b) Force varies as a function of time from positive to negative  to ensure time evolving force applied correctly with Initial velocity in x and z so full field is explored.
    c) Force constant in time but varies as a function of space, check vs constant acceleration equations
    d) As above but cycle x, y and z

    
2) Particle with wall in y direction and subject to a force in y
    a) Test free fall part vs constant acceleration 
    b) A regression test for the part where wall/particle interact. 


3) Particle rolling on surface? Bouncing on a surface?
    a) Coupler could apply rotating forces to model different slopes

===============
 Two Particles 
===============

1) Two particle colliding
    a) Apply force to both




This can then be extended to include extra terms (drag, added mass) etc.  

2) Use a varying coupled field and split into a number of constant accelerations regions based on an independant reading of the applied field
