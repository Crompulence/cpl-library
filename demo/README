The contents of this demo folder provide a rudimentary framework for performing
coupled simulations with CPL Library. The user is provided here with example 
codes written in both C++ and Fortran, as well as an example execution script.
Please see the end of this file for a description of all contents of this
directory.



Compilation
===========

To compile the example programs, use make:

    $  make 

This should compile, by default, the C++ MD and Fortran CFD demo applications.
The executable files are placed inside their respective sub-folders within the
directory named "run". To choose a configuration compiled from demo
applications written in different languages, call

    $  make [MDlanguage]-[CFDlanguage] 

where [MDlanguage] and [CFDlanguage] are replaced by either "cpp" or "fortran",
i.e. any of the following combinations: 

    cpp-cpp                       
    cpp-fortran
    fortran-cpp
    fortran-fortran 



Executing a coupled simulation
==============================

To run the two applications together in a coupled simulation, change
directory to the "run" folder, and execute the run script:

    $  cd run
    $  ./run.sh



Directory contents
==================

    makefile    - Self-explanatory

    cfd/        - CFD application source code directory 
    cfd/cfd.cpp - CFD application written in C++
    cfd/cfd.f90 - CFD application written in Fortran

    md/         - MD application source code directory 
    md/md.cpp   - MD application written in C++
    md/md.f90   - MD application written in Fortran

    run/        - Run directory
    run/md/     - MD executable and output directory
    run/cfd/    - CFD executable and output directory
    run/cpl/    - Directory for CPL Library input/output 
    run/run.sh  - Example execution script
