CPL Library socket 
==================

This directory is where the source code, libraries and binaries are stored for
the CPL Library socket. The source code is located in ./src/ and the
dynamic-link library binaries are created in a new folder ./lib/. 
Executable solver applications are created in the a folder ./bin.

The following environnment variables:

    FOAM_CPL_SOCKET_LIBBIN = $FOAM_INST_DIR/cpl-socket/lib
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH        = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$FOAM_CPL_LIBBIN

**must be defined** in order for a) the compilation to work and b) the library
to be found by the ld linker. They are conveniently defined in the config 
file SOURCEME, which may be found in the level above this README file: 

    $  cd ../
    $  source SOURCEME
    $  cd -


Compilation:
============

    $  ./Allwmake

N.B.: warnings from the included MPI headers may be ignored.
