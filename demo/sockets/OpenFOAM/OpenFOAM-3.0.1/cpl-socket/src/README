Overview of subdirectories in this folder:
==========================================

CPLPstream:

    OpenFOAM's parallel-computing communications supports a number of different
    paradigms, including MPI. In order to support all of them, it wraps all 
    communication functions in a library called "Pstream". CPL Library is based
    on MPI, but requires the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator to be split into 
    two "realm" communicators - one for MD, and the other for CFD. All 
    subsequent operations that would have been on MPI_COMM_WORLD in the MD
    and CFD coupled programs must now be called on the realm communicator
    CPL_REALM_COMM. 

    CPLPstream replicates OpenFOAM's MPI Pstream, where CPL_REALM_COMM has
    been substituted in place of MPI_COMM_WORLD.


CPLSocket:

    The interface to CPL Library is implemented in a single class named
    CPLSocket. This directory holds its source code. 

solvers:

    OpenFOAM is implemented as a set of libraries, and it is up to the 
    user to develop their own main-level applications that use these 
    libraries. This directory contains the source code for a coupled
    incompressible solver CPLIcoFoam that is based on OpenFOAM's icoFoam.
